These visualizations show that NBA performance is highly concentrated among a small group of key players. Most players receive limited minutes, score few points, and have low usage, while high-minute players account for the majority of scoring and shot attempts. The plots also confirm clear relationships between minutes and points, height and rebounds, and show that both scoring levels and career length vary strongly across players and historical eras.

These visualizations show that most NBA teams finish seasons with a moderate number of wins, while very successful or very weak teams are rare. Offensive and defensive points are right tilted, reflecting faster pace and higher scoring in more recent NBA eras. The pace and correlation analyses highlight that scoring, assists, and rebounds are strongly related to team performance, while wins are influenced by offense but not determined by it alone.

 These visualizations show that most NBA coaches have average win percentages, while very successful or very unsuccessful coaches are rare. Career wins and losses are strongly right tilted, indicating that total wins depend more on how long a coach stays in the league than on win rate alone. The distribution of seasons coached confirms that most coaches have short careers, with only a few lasting more than ten seasons.

 After preprocessing the data, we evaluated different numbers of clusters for a Gaussian Mixture Model using a likelihood-based elbow approach. We fitted GMMs with 2 to 15 clusters and observed how the negative log-likelihood changed as the number of clusters increased. The elbow curve hel

 This matrix shows how players move between roles from one season to the next. High values on the diagonal indicate that most players remain in the same role, while out of the diagonal values highlight common development or decline paths, such as bench players becoming regular rotation players. Overall, the matrix helps identify which roles are stable and how player roles typically evolve over time.

This visualization shows how the average metrics of each player role change over time across seasons.
